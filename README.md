A fashion and accessories e-commerce website.

# Description
It is a e-commerce website that contains a fashion and trendy accessories.

It's not 100% completed due to the Javascript. There are some of the functions are not working as they should be and so, I need to fix and update them. The current progress for this project is roughly 92%.

I used HTML, CSS (SCSS - CSS Preprocessors), a little bit of Bootstrap framework, JavaScript.

It also have JSON file to easy access the products array and blog post array if I want to add, edit, and delete some items and information.
